# seismicToolBox
Some Python functions for sorting, plotting, semblance analysis, stacking, and migrating seismic data.


Many of the functions here were developed by CREWES and were originally written in MATLAB.
We will soon refer each function we translated from CREWES to its original CREWES function name and the CREWES Matlab library at www.crewes.org.
Other functions were translated from MATLAB to Python and originally written by Max Holicki
for the course "Geophyiscal methods for subsurface characterization" tought at TU Delft.
